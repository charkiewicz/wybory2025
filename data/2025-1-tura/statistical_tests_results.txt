Chi-squared statistic: 2198.9353
P-value: 0
Significance level (alpha): 0.05
Result: The p-value (0) is less than alpha (0.05).
We reject the null hypothesis. The observed distribution of first digits significantly deviates from Benford's Law.

This could indicate anomalies, data manipulation, or that the dataset naturally does not follow Benford's Law.


--- Chi-squared Goodness-of-Fit Test (General Concept) ---

The Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is used to determine if an observed frequency distribution
of a categorical variable matches an expected (theoretical) frequency distribution.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The observed frequencies are consistent with the expected frequencies.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The observed frequencies are NOT consistent with the expected frequencies.

To perform this test, you need:
1. Observed frequencies (O_i) for each category.
2. Expected frequencies (E_i) for each category, based on your hypothesis.

The test statistic is calculated as: Chi^2 = sum_over_all_categories [ (O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i ]

The Benford's Law test performed above is a specific application of the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test,
where the 'categories' are the first digits (1-9) and the 'expected frequencies' are derived from Benford's Law.

Example of another potential application (requires defining expected distribution):
If you hypothesized that votes for a *particular candidate* should be uniformly distributed across, say,
10 equally sized polling stations (which is a strong and often unrealistic assumption), you would:
  - Observe the votes for that candidate in each of the 10 stations.
  - Calculate the total votes for that candidate across these 10 stations.
  - The expected votes for each station would be (Total Votes / 10).
  - Then apply the Chi-squared test with these observed and expected counts.

The key is defining a meaningful 'expected distribution' for your specific research question.
